----TO USE THE PROGRAM----

the program can be opened by the executable file found in the path :
X:\...\Computer-Security-Methods\CS\x64\Release
the .exe file is called CS. 

---- TO VIEW THE CODE----

the code is configured using VISUAL STUDIO2022, the solution file CS.sln can be found in the path : 
X:\...\Computer-Security-Methods\CS

opening CS.sln will open VISUALSTUDIO22, also you can run the code from the IDE it self. 

the files are organized in a folder called src, but when you open the solution in VS they are filtered in virtual filters for headers and .cpp files. 
the header file contain the decleration of functions and or classes, structs, etc..

the .CPP files contain the functionality of the code. 

the program flow is configured in main.cpp, where depending on the user choice (a,b,or c) the program will behave and produce the user required mechanisim.

---- How to operate ----

when the program is ran, the prompt screen will appear and the user is asked to choose between : 
a. Data confidentiality assurance by symmetric encryption.
b. Message Authentication assurance.
c. Data confidentiality assurance by hybrid encryption (digital envelope).

(note : please use small letters to choose)

then if the flow requires another input from the user, it will show a text asking for it. 

everything printed on the window should be as required by the assignment, from texts, ciphertexts, keys generated, etc...
